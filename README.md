**Mind Master 🧠 Game using Tkinter GUI - python**
# The Game 🕹️
Mind Master🤴🏼 is trying to guess a code in the least number of tries by knowing how many numbers you got correct and how many numbers are in their correct positions.

And in this code there are 2 options 
* One player 👤
* Two Players 👥

In the first one,The computer generates a 4 digit random code and you try to guess it🧐

The Second option is that one player writes the code and the other Player tries to guess it and whoever gets the code in the least tries wins🏆

# Note 📋
**The console📟code is commented down in the code if you don't want to use a GUI**

**If you want a competetion between the 2 players in the same time you can find it on my github😺in the repo called crack the code**
